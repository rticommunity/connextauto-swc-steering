# Software Component : Steering Column Demo

## Introduction

Demonstrate Sterring Column control use case using RTI Connext DDS.

## Dependencies

- Python

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
  ```

- RTI Connext Professional 7.3 LTS

- [connextauto-bus](https://github.com/rticommunity/connextauto-bus) provides the common data model, data interfaces, common build system, and component
launcher for components in the connextauto ecosystem, and it is:

  - Located at the path specified by the environment variable `$DATABUSHOME`
  - **(if not done already)** Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/rticommunity/connextauto-bus?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) instructions in the [`$DATABUSHOME/README.md`](https://github.com/rticommunity/connextauto-bus?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to generate the datatypes for the *RTI Connext SDK*(s) used by this component



## Getting Started

- Clone (or fork and clone) this repo

      git clone <a_git_url_to_this_repository>

- Build for the target $RTI_ARCH

      export RTI_ARCH=x64Linux4gcc7.3.0
      make -f makefile_SteeringTypes_$RTI_ARCH

- Run the applications using the launcher scripts

      $DATABUSHOME/bin/run Steering ./objs/$RTI_ARCH/SteeringColumn_<app>
    
  For documentation on the `$DATABUSHOME/bin/run` launcher utility, please refer to the documentation located at [`$DATABUSHOME/doc/Run.md`](https://github.com/rticommunity/connextauto-bus/blob/develop/doc/Run.md).


## Component Overview

The demo comprises of three applications exchanging data over the RTI Connext Databus, using DDS.

- SteeringColumn
- SteeringController
- Ssteering Display
